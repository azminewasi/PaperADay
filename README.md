# **#PaperADay** - 13

In the rapidly evolving realm of artificial intelligence, keeping up with the latest research papers can be a daunting task. Yet, for those driven by an insatiable curiosity and a burning passion for AI, staying in touch with cutting-edge developments is not just essential—it's exhilarating. This is hy I started the #PaperADay challenge, a transformative initiative that invites individuals to embark on a journey of intellectual growth by reading one AI paper every single day.

***This repository contains a list papers I read and the reviews.***
